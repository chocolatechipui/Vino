###A Reference App for ChocolateChip-UI

This is an example of how to build a Web app using ChocolateChip-UI. It uses jQuery as DOM JavaScript library. There are a number of customizations of ChocolateChip-UI's default layouts and widgets. Each app presents different challenges to create the right user experience for what it needs to do. Because ChocolateChip-UI is just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, if you are proficient in these, you can customize the framework to suit your needs. 

We created ChocolateChip-UI to satisfy the largest possible number of use cases, but it's surprising how many apps have requirements beyond these. If when building an app with ChocolateChip-UI you find yourself in a situation where you need different behavior, then rename or create new class names, copy the styles and modify them to suit your purpose. Same thing with the widgets, copy the one that's closest, rename it and modify the JavaScript to suit your needs.

This app was created to run efficiently in desktop Safari, as well as on iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S, 6, 6 Plus and iPads running iOS 7 or 8. This app can also be pinned to the home screen so that it can run in standalone mode, resulting in a more native-like experience. 

With some theme adjustments, this app could just as easily be converted into and Android or Windows Phone 8 Web app.
